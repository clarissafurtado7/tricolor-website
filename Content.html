          <h1>So since this is a template, and I don't want to go get a Lorem Ipsum because that's boring, here is my commentary on Howl's Moving Castle (unstructured and mildly incoherent)</h1>
          <h2>Howl's Moving Castle</h2>
    <p id="text">Sophie is great I love her sm
<br>HOWL
<br>WHAT THE ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†
<br>THIS MAN CAN CRACK AN EGG WITH ONE HAND
<br>get yourself a man who can crack eggs one-handed
<br>dude I would literally date someone for this skill (and make them teach me obvs)
<br>I AM NOT OVER IT
<br>HE CAN CRACK EGGS WITH ONE HAND
<br>THIS IS THE ONLY THING IM PROCESSING
<br>also his voice is amazing
<br>like do some ASMR its so soothing and smooth its great I love it
<br>howl: reads a threat from a powerful magic user using ancient magic
<br>also howl: "that can't be good for the table"
<br>woah wtf man just flew straight into [the bad place idk if that counts as a curse word??]
<br>he's going to join cas lmaooo
<br>anyway whatever the duck howls gender has got going on? that. just that.
<br>my man howl really did go straight to [one might say tartarus]??
<br>and he's a ? raven? now
<br>to be fair he's a magical being so it's not that surprising
<br>off topic (howl is still in [the fire and flames of eternal torment]) but like howl's earrings? *chef's kiss* amazing showstopping incredible I love them
<br>they also look like clip-ons in this scene lmaoooo
<br>maybe they are idk
<br>wow dude made it out of [one could also say the fields of punishment] just like cas
<br>anyway gonna stop with the supernatural references I haven't even watched the show üò≠
<br>ok so hes got some secret demon energy going on, I see
<br>not howl running down the stairs screaming üíÄ
<br>he's crying this is so funny
<br>sorry that's kind of mean
<br>but I am laughing rn
<br>he's on team [a friend] w hating redheads
<br>HE CALLED HIMSELF REPULSIVE SIR IT'S JUST RED HAIR üíÄ
<br>"I see no point in living if I can't be beautiful" lmao mood
<br>but also sir chill out blond hair is not the defining trait that makes people hot
<br>oof that's weird vibes gonna move on
<br>"he's calling the spirits of darkness. I saw him do this once before when a girl dumped him" screaming this man is just a drama queen
<br>like dude chill just redye it
<br>thank you Sophie for being the voice of reason
<br>now he's oozing??? wtf dude chill
<br>yeah howl chill the ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† out dude
<br>and awww poor Sophie someone give her a hug
<br>yesss scarecrow is out here doing the most proud of them
<br>we all need a friend like scarecrow (turnip-head? turnip? idk)
<br>my man is throwing a tantrum butt naked like sir? sir please
<br>also sir do not leave the child to be forced to take care of you
<br>howl is such a dramatic ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†
<br>honestly it's funny but I would be on my last nerve if I had to deal with it
<br>would have straight up ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†ing killed this man
<br>however Sophie is a much better person than me, kudos to her for putting up with this man
<br>no wait hold up
<br>prediction time
<br>the witch of the wastes is his ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†ing ex???
<br>SHE ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†ING IS
<br>sort of ig he doesn't say they had a relationship
<br>but honestly dude just ghosted her????
<br>not gonna say he deserves it ...
<br>but Sophie didn't deserve to get caught up in this mess
<br>otherwise it would be very funny and deserved
<br>as long as there was no injuries n stuff involved
<br>awww sophie is so naive :((((
<br>she's about to get her innocence ruined D:
<br>howl is really out there dragging himself lmaoooo
<br>bruh is he not wearing clothes??? sir where is your self-respect??? your dignity????
<br>although i respect his right to a blanket cloak
<br>SIR I RESPECT YOUR BLANKET CLOAK RIGHTS BUT PLEASE WEAR CLOTHING OUTSIDE
<br>lmaooo Sophie telling it like it is proud of her she's the best
<br>sophie is such a sweetheart she deserves the world
<br>ummm so is the magician person aware that Sophie isn't really Howl's mother,,,, or does she think some sort of Oedipus complex thing is going on......
<br>ok every time they say Howl I mishear it as Hal and have to mentally correct myself and remember the characters
<br>well that escalated quickly [in reference to sophie confessing]
<br>its been an hour fifteen but I feel like it's sudden for some reason
<br>like obviously I saw it coming from a mile away but still
<br>idk
<br>anyway
<br>did calcifer steal Howl's heart?
<br>love is love ‚ù§Ô∏è
<br>dude I ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†in love them
<br>howl, Sophie, calcifer, everyone
<br>also found family??? Howl calling them a family???? my heart
<br>I love them so much the found family has stolen my heart I loved them before but now I love them even more they're so great can you tell I love the found family trope I love the found family trope
<br>ok I said this before but Howl's gender? that.
<br>doing some glyph magic, nice
<br>he said our family again I love him
<br>the way into my heart is the found family trope apparently
<br>like i know i said i would hate Howl in real life before but please adopt me sir
<br>dude okay I ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†in love Howl now he's the best
<br>like sir adopt me
<br>make me part of your family
<br>anyway
<br>OH MY GOD
<br>ITS SO BEAUTIFUL
<br>I AM LOST FOR WORDS
<br>NO IS HOWL GONNA DIE
<br>NO IM EMOTIONALLY ATTACHED NOW YOU CANT DO THIS
<br>like I probably would have laughed in the first bit BUT NOW I LOVE HIM
<br>STOP üò≠
<br>is howl a pacifist?
<br>honestly I'm here for it
<br>antiwar howl for the win
<br>IS HOWL OKAY
<br>I NEED HIM TO BE OKAY
<br>honestly I'm so emotionally invested now
<br>"I love you; you have to stay" MY HEART
<br>I LOVE ALL OF THEM SO MUCH
<br>"'cause we're a family now" AJDJUFHSBSHDJBEJS THEM

<br>of course she did
<br>dumb‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†
<br>NO IT WAS GOING SO WELL ‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† I HATE WHEN THIS HAPPENS

<br>ok nvm he's fine
<br>damn Sophie's just saving everyone today

<br>the prince is mad he doesn't get his true love
<br>I mean ... throuples exist
<br>that's not gonna happen though
